### technical information
- all files are compressed with p7zip (https://www.7-zip.org/) 
- files are provided json generated by python (inside is one big dict)
- after unzipping files are 100-200 times bigger (check available space on your disk!)

### data format
- data is stored as big one python dict, with following keys:
    - dict['status'] here is always just 'ok' string which confirms that the calculation was successfully ended
    - dict['cycles'] list of cycles in graph (here only cycles with length of 5 reactions or less are stored)
    - dict['results'] dict where keys are smiles of reactants/products, e.g. dict['results']['C=C(C=NCC#N)c1ccccc1']. Such entry is also python dict with following keys:
        - parents - reactants which gave this product
        - otherParents - other reactans which gave this compound
        - history - list of all reactions from initial reactants to this compounds (synthetic path). Each step in history is dict with following entries: 
            - smiles - reaction smiles
            - description - reaction name
            - reference - literature reference to the reaction type
            - additionalInfo - reaction's thermochemistry (dG, dS, dH calculated with Benson group contribution), and estimated (based on literature precedents) yield. Benson estimation is not very accurate for heterocycles so we switch to semi empirical calculation and dS, dG, dH may be 0 in the files. For more accurate thermochemistry see file *molecule_data/heatOfFormation.csv*
            - condAB - reaction conditions: acidic, neutral, base or any combination of this
            - conditions - textual description of reaction condition
        - alterHistories - list of list of alternative synthetic paths. Each step has the same format as in "history".
        - all other entries should be self explanatory
- data in json format correspond to python's pickle file 

### information about files
- tree_of_life_6generations_CNO tree with compounds up to 6th synthetic generation with mass limit 300g/mol and 5 reactans: water, amonia, nitrogen, methane and HCN.
- tree_of_life_6generations_CNOS tree with compounds up to 6th synthetic generation with mass limit 300g/mol and 5 reactans: water, amonia, nitrogen, methane, HCN and H2S.
- tree_of_life_7generations_CNO tree with compounds up to 7th synthetic generation with mass limit 300g/mol and 5 reactans: water, amonia, nitrogen, methane and HCN.
- tree_of_life_7generations_CNOS tree with compounds up to 7th synthetic generation with mass limit 300g/mol and 5 reactans: water, amonia, nitrogen, methane, HCN and H2S.



In subdirectories `tree_of_lile_with_removed_reaction_class_*` there are full trees (in json format commpresed with p7zip) and smiles list from each tree

### hints
- if you are interesed in testing your hypothesis (e.g. what can be formed without some reactions etc, is it possible to make compound XXX without reaction YYY and/or reactant ZZZ and so on) the best way is to build graph from the data
- if you want to load data as graph, graph_tool seems to be the best choice (for example see gtCycleShortLenMultiproc.py)
- if you have any questions please contact with us
