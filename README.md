Data deposited here consiststs of two parts:

# tree-of-life
Tree of life as calculated by the Allchemy software and described in the paper are stored in subdirectory *data/*
An examples of scripts which demonstrate how to work with deposited data are collected in subdirectory *scripts/* some calculated statistics about tree-of-life graph are stored in subdirectory *precalculatedGraphStats/*

# molecular properties
Molecular properites of compounds obtained from full tree-of-life are deposited in subdirectory *molecule_data/*
